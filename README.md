# Chemical-Equation-Balancer
This is a code that was made for a homework assignment for CS 4630 at Bowling Green State University by Colton Barger.

This program allows the user to select their own text document which should contain a list of unbalanced chemical equations. The program balances all of the equations, and allows the user to do stoichiometry calculations (either in grams or in moles). An example text document containing unbalanced chemical equations will look like:

CO2 + H2O = C6H12O6 + O2  
Al + HCl = AlCl3 + H2  
Na2CO3 + HCl = NaCl + H2O + CO2  
C7H6O2 + O2 = CO2 + H2O  
Fe2(SO4)3 + KOH = K2SO4 + Fe(OH)3  
Al2(SO4)3 + Ca(OH)2 = Al(OH)3 + CaSO4  
H2SO4 + HI = H2S + I2 + H2O  
Ca3(PO4)2 + SiO2 = P4O10 + CaSiO3  
Cu + HNO3 = Cu(NO3)2 + NO + H2O  
S + HNO3 = H2SO4 + NO2 + H2O  

All of the compounds should be separated by ' + ', and the reactants and products should be separated by ' = '. Each unbalanced equation is on a new line of the text file. The code assumes correct input of all chemical equations.

The Excel sheet PeriodicTableData.xlsx is necessary for any stoichiometric calculations.
